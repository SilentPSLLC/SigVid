# SigVid
SigVid is a Signal-based video downloader and responder. It listens for video links via Signal, downloads the videos, and sends them back to the sender. Logs and data are stored securely in MySQL or SQLite for security and debugging. Built with Python and Docker, SigVid is ideal for automated media handling.
